#Website with MDL and CI
---
This is a personal website use Material Design Lite and CodeIgniter. The purpose is to get familiar with MDL and CI, and maybe this website can also help me do something extra.




#CodeIgniter
---
For now this project use version 3.0.6.

Details about CI can be found [there](https://www.codeigniter.com/).

For images, css and javascript files, I put them into folder called 'public', which is under root directory.




#Material Design Lite
---
For now this project use version 1.1.3.

You can find its official website [here](https://getmdl.io/).

**Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesnâ€™t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible.**


Because when I start this project I was physically in China, and I failed to access hosted files on their CDN, which use google server. So I downloaded everything I need, including more than 300 Megabites Icon files. In header files, I use local url link.
